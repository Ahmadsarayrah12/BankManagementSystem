Project Name: Bank Management System

Description:
This is a C++ console application that simulates a basic banking system with a menu-driven interface for managing client accounts and financial transactions. Key features include:

Add new clients: Store client information such as account number, PIN, name, and balance.

Update client details: Modify existing account information securely.

Delete clients: Remove accounts when necessary.

Search clients: Quickly find client details by account number.

Display all accounts: View a summary of all clients and their balances.

Transactions Menu:

Deposit: Increase a client’s balance.

Withdraw: Safely decrease a client’s balance.

Total Balances: Display the total balance of all accounts.

Return to Main Menu: Go back to the main menu.

The project uses file handling to store client data permanently and structured programming concepts like structs, enums, and functions to organize the code efficiently.

Skills Demonstrated:

C++ programming and understanding of structured programming principles.

File I/O operations for saving and retrieving data.

Console-based menu-driven applications with financial logic.

Data management and validation.

Purpose:
Designed as a learning project for beginners and intermediate programmers to practice C++ fundamentals while simulating real-world data and financial operations.
